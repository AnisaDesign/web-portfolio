          Examining the Effect of Time on the Design of Mobile Applications
        </h2>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
              This paper investigates and explores the effect of time on the
              design of mobile applications through the research of storage
              apps. The author will analyze app development and evolution, as
              well as compare the designs and updates. The psychological,
              neurological, technological and historical aspects of the subject
              will be discussed in this paper. A conclusion will be provided at
              the end to summarize the findings and provide suggestions to
              Graphic Design practitioners.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              The time influences everything. Mobile application designs undergo
              the most scrutiny. As users, we often notice updates in branding
              and app icons because we look at them on the daily basis. Not only
              their design change from over time, but also the devices that
              carry them. In order to understand how time influences the designs
              of mobile apps, it is important to look back and investigate how
              smartphones came to exist and what necessities have pushed the
              society to invent new ways of communications.
            </p>
            <p>
              This research will reveal the factual, technical, practical and
              psychological perspectives about the given subject. The first
              chapter of this paper will investigate the origins of smartphones,
              their operating systems, as well as the evolution of application
              designs. Primarily, we will talk about Psion Organizer, EPOC
              operating system, Palm Pilot PDA, Nokia phones that introduced
              entertainment to the mass phone market, Apple’s iPod and iPhone.
              In terms of design we will cover skeuomorphic, flat, and material
              designs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In chapter two the author will provide three case studies that
              show how selected mobile applications change over time in terms of
              color, icon and typography. We will provide a connection between
              these design changes and mobile operating system trends. Having
              reviewed the history of the app design changes between 2007 and
              2017, we will identify the common patterns that companies apply in
              order to stand out among the crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last chapter will dive deeper and investigate why users
              require a regular stream of updates, what forces them to expect
              new features, and explore new options.
