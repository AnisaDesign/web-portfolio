        <h2 class="research-title">The Causes of the Heatwave in 2023 and an Interaction Designers Initiative to Highlight the Climate Change Crisis Through a Tree Planting Campaign</h2>
    </div>
    <article>

            <p>I moved to beautiful British Columbia in May 2017 and at that time it was a big pleasure to spend summer here. The summer was not too hot and not too cold. The cool breeze in the evenings pleasantly blew my face every time I went out for a walk, and I felt nice summer rain from time to time. I didn’t want to spend summer anywhere else but staying here, in North Vancouver up until this year.</p>
            <p>By 2023 things had changed and those residents, who spent summer in North Vancouver, BC experienced the heatwave and the anomaly of the weather. The province that I came to six years ago looked completely different this summer. By 2023 - the forests were on fire and that brought the smoke to the North Vancouver area, after the grass was burned already in May. I was wearing a mask as the town was covered in smoke and residents were encouraged to stay home, keep the windows closed and drink a lot of water. I remember that tree shade helped me to escape the sunlight at that moment. I realized that urban areas need more trees for oxygen and shade. At that time I wanted to move back to 2017 when summer was cool and rainy. I wanted to escape from the heatwave and smoke. But escaping is not a solution. The solution is to find the causes of the heatwave and wildfire and what we, interaction designers can do to raise the awareness about climate change.One of the solutions can be to launch a climate change campaign. According to Cousins, the Director of Digital Marketing at Designmodo, Interaction designers are people who help “create a design strategy, identify key interactions of the product, create prototypes to test concepts.” (Cousins). We are strategic and creative people and I truly believe that interaction designers are well placed to nurture a community tree planting initiative in urban North Vancouver to highlight a valuable climate change crisis solution.</p>
            <p>In June 2023 the Government of British Columbia stated on their website that there were 457 wildfires that burned 869, 861 hectares since April 1, 2023 (The Government of British Columbia). Sounds like a joke on April 1st but unfortunately it is our reality nowadays. The temperature toped 41.4 degrees Celsius, according to CBC News, and it was the highest heatwave recorded by the “Lytton” weather station that led to wildfires across British Columbia “Temperature Tops 40” (CBC News). The closest one to North Vancouver was discovered near Baden Powell Trail, Lynn Canyon on July 17, 2023 (see fig. 1). It was the second wildfire in less than a week in North Vancouver, whereas the first one was on Mount Seymour in the same week (Hasegawa, R.).</p>

    <p>What is causing the recent heatwaves in BC? According to the Government of British Columbia website there are two broad causes of the wildfire. One of them is Lightning that causes 60% of the wildfires. Another one is Human activity, such as industrial activity, open burning, vehicle and engine use, fireworks, outdoor flame lightning, sky-lanterns, discarding burning items like cigarettes, and others that cause 40% of wildfires (The Government of British Columbia).</p>
    <p><b>As human beings we cannot control the lightning, but what is under our control is human activity.</b> Interaction designers rely on powerful software and technologies and as a digital designer I am more concerned about how industrial activity, such as manufacturing of technology devices lead to climate change and how? The technology devices are rapidly changing and growing. Based on the chart of infoNewt, Apple corporation releases new phones, laptops, desktop computers, iPads, almost every year depending on the model and type of the product (Infonewt). I believe that each new release of technologies dictates a new trend that most people want to follow. But what might be the consequences of constant demand for new devices? Fawole discussed in his article for the academic journal “Bulletin of the National Research Centre” that the growing and constant demand for new electronic devices and overall short use of them drives the extraction of new metals. It contributes indirectly to “higher energy consumption and associated GHG (greenhouse gases) emissions” (5). It makes the consumers buy new devices and/or replace the old ones that lead to electronic waste or e-waste for short. According to the online Cambridge dictionary e-waste refers to “computers, phones, and other electronic products that are thrown away, because they are old, broken, etc.” (Cambridge Dictionary). Not only the production of new devices causes the climate change, but also the inadequate management of e-waste. According to Fawole:
        Other harmful substances contained within e-waste, such as heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, are often released into the environment. Although these substances do not directly contribute to climate change, they pose significant environmental and health risks (Maia et al. 2020. Moreover, the release of these substances can disrupt ecosystems and biodiversity, which can indirectly exacerbate climate change impacts by compromising the resilience of these systems to climate change and their capacity to act as carbon sinks (5).
