          <p>
            I chose to design a self-service kiosk interface for Subway for two
            main reasons. First, in North America Subway currently lacks a
            dedicated self-service kiosk option. Second, on a personal level, I
            often find it challenging to interact with employees at
            Subway either due to difficulty understanding them or not knowing
            the names of specific ingredients. This experience often leads to
            anxiety and frustration. I would much prefer the ease and
            independence of using a self-service kiosk.

          <p>
            The purpose of this project is to create an intuitive, efficient, and accessible self-service kiosk experience that simplifies the ordering process for Subway customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The current interface presents several challenges, including unclear navigation, lack of feedback, and an overwhelming customization process, especially when too many choices are presented at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to design a new solution that prioritizes usability and focuses on a truly user-centered experience.

              In my research and analysis of Subway, I discovered numerous
              reviews from unsatisfied customers who shared similar frustrations
              to my own. Reading these reviews provided valuable insights into
              what’s missing and highlighted the importance of Subway
              considering a self-service kiosk to help reduce customer
              frustrations and improve the overall experience.

              ordering process I decided to go with my favourite Steak & Cheese
              sandwich, which surprisingly I could only find in Best Sellers
              section, but not in “Menu: Subway Series” landing page. I paid
              extra attention to the customization process, which includes the

            Based on the feedback provided, the overall experience with the
            Subway self-service kiosk prototype seems to be quite positive.
            Users appreciated the clean, intuitive interface, which made
            navigation easy. The visual design, such as clear images and the use
            of colors like yellow to guide actions, was well-received. The
            progress bar, breadcrumb navigation, and step-by-step process were
            found to be helpful in keeping users informed and reducing
            confusion.

            Key strengths of the prototype included its efficiency in saving
            time and reducing miscommunication. The inclusion of descriptions
            for each sandwich and the ability to customize options, such as
            “more” or “less” of certain ingredients, were noted as useful
            features. However, some users suggested improvements, such as making
            the "None" option more intuitive and adjusting the order of certain
            pop-up windows for better flow.

            In terms of payment options, the kiosk was considered secure and
            intuitive, with straightforward icons and navigation. While users
            found the ordering process to be efficient, the transition between
            customization and finalizing the order could be improved by
            presenting the sandwich description first.

            Overall, the self-service kiosk was seen as a convenient and
            time-saving option, especially when compared to traditional counter
            ordering. Users expressed a preference for kiosks as they allow for
            a more streamlined experience without the need to wait in line.
            Despite some minor suggestions for improvement, the kiosk met users'
            expectations for an easy, fast, and visually engaging ordering
            experience.
