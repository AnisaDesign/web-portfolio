    </div>
   
    <div class="subtext02">
        <p>I chose to design a self-service kiosk interface for Subway for two main reasons. First, Subway currently lacks a dedicated self-service kiosk option. Second, on a personal level, I often find it challenging to interact with employees at Subway—either due to difficulty understanding them or not knowing the names of specific ingredients. This experience often leads to anxiety and frustration. I would much prefer the ease and independence of using a self-service kiosk.</p>

The current interface has some challenges, such as unclear navigation, lack of feedback, and customization process might feel overwhelming for users, especially with too many choices presented at once. I want to make the new design being focused on the usability and user-centred.</p>

Through user feedback, we identified communication issues and feature struggles, leading us to simplify messaging and improve clarity. We focused on enhancing priority features that mattered most, like combining community tools for a more engaging experience. The research also helped us refine rewards like Circle Points, making them more accessible and aligned with user needs. Additionally, we emphasized community engagement by creating opportunities for users to interact, making the platform more enjoyable and functional.</p>
