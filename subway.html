      SUBWAY Sandwich

    </div>
   
    <div class="subtext02">
        <p>I chose to design a self-service kiosk interface for Subway for two main reasons. First, Subway currently lacks a dedicated self-service kiosk option. Second, on a personal level, I often find it challenging to interact with employees at Subway—either due to difficulty understanding them or not knowing the names of specific ingredients. This experience often leads to anxiety and frustration. I would much prefer the ease and independence of using a self-service kiosk.</p>

The current interface has some challenges, such as unclear navigation, lack of feedback, and customization process might feel overwhelming for users, especially with too many choices presented at once.

          <p class="sub-text">I have done the Heuristic Review of the Subway’s official website, specifically the homepage and the ordering process.
            For the ordering process I decided to go with my favourite Steak & Cheese sandwich, which surprisingly I could only find in Best Sellers section, but not in “Menu: Subway Series” landing page. 
            I paid extra attention to the customization process, which includes the Size, the type of Bread, Protein, Cheese, Veggies, Seasonings, Add-Ons and here is what I found:

          <h2 class="title">SUMMARY</h2>
          <p>Based on the feedback provided, the overall experience with the Subway self-service kiosk prototype seems to be quite positive. Users appreciated the clean, intuitive interface, which made navigation easy. The visual design, such as clear images and the use of colors like yellow to guide actions, was well-received. The progress bar, breadcrumb navigation, and step-by-step process were found to be helpful in keeping users informed and reducing confusion.</p>
          <p>Key strengths of the prototype included its efficiency in saving time and reducing miscommunication. The inclusion of descriptions for each sandwich and the ability to customize options, such as “more” or “less” of certain ingredients, were noted as useful features. However, some users suggested improvements, such as making the "None" option more intuitive and adjusting the order of certain pop-up windows for better flow.</p>
          <p>In terms of payment options, the kiosk was considered secure and intuitive, with straightforward icons and navigation. While users found the ordering process to be efficient, the transition between customization and finalizing the order could be improved by presenting the sandwich description first.</p>
          <p>Overall, the self-service kiosk was seen as a convenient and time-saving option, especially when compared to traditional counter ordering. Users expressed a preference for kiosks as they allow for a more streamlined experience without the need to wait in line. Despite some minor suggestions for improvement, the kiosk met users' expectations for an easy, fast, and visually engaging ordering experience.</p>
