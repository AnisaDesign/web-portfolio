Anisa shows up with a calm, reliable presence and is always willing to step in where needed. She communicates clearly, takes ownership of her responsibilities, and genuinely cares about contributing to a strong team effort. She would be a great asset to any team.”</p>

      <p>“It was such a pleasure having Anisa as our Client Experience Intern. She brought a kind, positive energy to every project and quickly became a key part of our team. Anisa focused on improving the user experience of our internal SharePoint sites and did a great job. Her thoughtful design of the carousel element and divider bar, using our brand colours, really stood out.</p> 
      <p>She was always eager to help wherever needed, worked independently, and came to meetings well-prepared. Her final presentation, complete with video-based FAQ instructions, was a great example of her initiative and attention to detail. We truly enjoyed getting to know her and appreciated her helpful and fun attitude throughout the internship.”</p>
