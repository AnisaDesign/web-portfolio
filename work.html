            <p class="medium-text">I proceeded to investigate the local non profit organizations that work with the victims of domestic violence. I really like the concept of The Today Centre. The sunrise gives a feeling of the new day, new beginning. The sky blue colour in combination of yellow, white and red gives a feeling of fresh beginning, new page in life. It gives a sense of security and trust. I really like the simplicity, illustrations and colour choice of the “Respect” NPO for men who went through domestic Violence. The illustrations look interesting and eye-catchy.</p>
