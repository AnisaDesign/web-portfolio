            <p>
              My Capstone project, Recycling Right, is a guidance and management
              app that helps users navigate local recycling systems with
              confidence. Growing up in Kyrgyzstan, where recycling was rarely
              practiced, I always felt uneasy about the waste around me. Later,
              I moved to South Korea, where recycling is taken very seriously.
              It was a challenge to learn at first, but I became fascinated by
              how organized and thoughtful the system was. After settling in
              Canada, I noticed that even in a country that promotes recycling,
              the rules can still feel confusing and inconsistent. This inspired
              me to design a solution that not only simplifies recycling but
              also supports environmental goals by reducing landfill waste,
              conserving natural resources, and lowering pollution and
              emissions.

                <p>
                  Improper waste disposal and recycling confusion are major
                  challenges in Vancouver, where a significant portion of
                  recyclable materials still ends up in landfills.

                <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
                <p>
                  An app designed to provide clear, localized recycling
                  guidelines, intuitive sorting assistance, and educational
                  prompts that help users build better recycling habits, reduce
                  landfill waste, and contribute to a more sustainable and
                  environmentally conscious community.

                  disposal instructions and offers directions to the nearest
                  recycling depot, ensuring users can responsibly dispose of
                  items with ease.

                  surveys, where 77% of respondents expressed confusion about
                  sorting materials, and 45% reported a lack of clear recycling
                  information. Additionally, interviews revealed that users
                  often miss recycling truck schedules. To tackle these issues,
                  the home page features a recycling day reminder, provides the
                  recycling truck schedule, and offers information on various
                  types of recyclable materials.

                To explore the recycling challenges in British Columbia,
                especially for newcomers settling in Vancouver, I conducted a
                multi-method research process. This included a literature review
                of regional waste management reports and public recycling
                resources, a quantitative survey with 22 participants and
                in-depth interviews with 4 individuals to gather personal
                experiences and behavioral insights. I also performed a
                competitor analysis of existing recycling tools and mobile apps
                to identify gaps and opportunities in user engagement,
                communication, and feature design.

                To explore the recycling challenges in British Columbia,
                especially for newcomers settling in Vancouver, I conducted a
                multi-method research process. This included a literature review
                of regional waste management reports and public recycling
                resources, a quantitative survey with 22 participants and
                in-depth interviews with 4 individuals to gather personal
                experiences and behavioral insights. I also performed a
                competitor analysis of existing recycling tools and mobile apps
                to identify gaps and opportunities in user engagement,
                communication, and feature design.

                <p>
                  Aisha is a newcomer who struggles with recycling due to
                  unclear sorting guidelines and differences from the system she
                  was familiar with in her home country. The lack of
                  straightforward, localized information leaves her feeling
                  confused and anxious about making mistakes. This often results
                  in feelings of embarrassment or hesitation when trying to
                  recycle correctly.

                  How might we make recycling easier and more approachable for
                  newcomers like Aisha by offering clear, culturally sensitive
                  information and reducing the fear of doing it wrong?

              <h2 class="title">LEARNING</h2>
              <p>
                This project deepened my understanding of how design can
                directly support social good and everyday behavior change.
                Through user research and feedback, I learned how important it
                is to create simple, intuitive flows, especially when addressing
                complex topics like recycling.
              </p>

              <p>
                Presenting the prototype to users helped me recognize the value
                of clear information hierarchy and visual clarity. Users
                consistently appreciated when features were not only functional,
                but also easy to find and understand. This reinforced the
                importance of designing with both usability and accessibility in
                mind.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also learned the value of iteration and feedback. Every round
                of testing helped refine the experience, from improving the
                scanning flow to introducing helpful features like the Home
                screen, truck schedule, and recycling reminders.
              </p>

              <p>
                Overall, this project reminded me that good design is not just
                about aesthetics, it’s about creating meaningful, useful tools
                that empower people in their everyday lives.
