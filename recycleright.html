          <p>
            My Capstone project, Recycling Right, is a guidance and management app that helps users navigate local recycling systems with confidence. Growing up in Kyrgyzstan, where recycling was rarely practiced, I always felt uneasy about the waste around me. Later, I moved to South Korea, where recycling is taken very seriously. It was a challenge to learn at first, but I became fascinated by how organized and thoughtful the system was. After settling in Canada, I noticed that even in a country that promotes recycling, the rules can still feel confusing and inconsistent. This inspired me to design a solution that not only simplifies recycling but also supports environmental goals by reducing landfill waste, conserving natural resources, and lowering pollution and emissions.

              To explore the recycling challenges in British Columbia, especially for newcomers settling in Vancouver, I conducted a multi-method research process. This included a literature review of regional waste management reports and public recycling resources, a quantitative survey with 22 participants and in-depth interviews with 4 individuals to gather personal experiences and behavioral insights. I also performed a competitor analysis of existing recycling tools and mobile apps to identify gaps and opportunities in user engagement, communication, and feature design.

                Aisha is a newcomer who struggles with recycling due to unclear sorting guidelines and differences from the system she was familiar with in her home country. The lack of straightforward, localized information leaves her feeling confused and anxious about making mistakes. This often results in feelings of embarrassment or hesitation when trying to recycle correctly.

            <p>
              This project deepened my understanding of how design can directly support social good and everyday behavior change. Through user research and feedback, I learned how important it is to create simple, intuitive flows, especially when addressing complex topics like recycling.            </p>

            <p>
              Presenting the prototype to users helped me recognize the value of clear information hierarchy and visual clarity. Users consistently appreciated when features were not only functional, but also easy to find and understand. This reinforced the importance of designing with both usability and accessibility in mind.            </p>

            <p>
              I also learned the value of iteration and feedback. Every round of testing helped refine the experience, from improving the scanning flow to introducing helpful features like the Home screen, truck schedule, and recycling reminders.
            </p>  

            <p>Overall, this project reminded me that good design is not just about aesthetics, it’s about creating meaningful, useful tools that empower people in their everyday lives.
