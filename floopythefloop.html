              Floopy the Floop started as a character my daughter created in
              2022, which I later turned into a sticker series featuring themes
              like the original Floopy, Christmas, and Easter. Inspired to
              expand this project, I developed Floopy into a character with
              potential for a children’s e-book series, including stories
              like "The Summer Adventures of Floopy," "Floopy Joins the
              Choir," and "Floopy’s First Christmas Tree." Each story unfolds
              with Floopy’s curious, lively, and playful spirit, bringing joy
              and excitement to every adventure.

              playful, soft shapes and bright colors to appeal to young children

              It all started with a character that my daughter Adeliia created

              her creation, I began building a brand around Floopy, turning her
              illustrations into fun sticker sheets. Now, Floopy brings a little
              extra cheer to people of all ages, from kids to seniors, as they
              stick him wherever they like!

                At the top, I created an animation of Floopy walking along the
                hills and waving to the audience when reaching the center of the
                frame. With this concept, I wanted to welcome users to Floopy’s

                For the second storytelling instance, I wanted to make it
                playful and humorous. The scene takes place at night, with the
                book cover acting as a door. Floopy playfully throws his winter
                boots out, then says “Hi, I’m here” or “Peekaboo” to the
                audience.

                In the third storytelling instance, Floopy raises his banner up
                and down. This motion element is placed in the footer and
                conveys Floopy saying goodbye. Raising the banner serves as a
                reminder, as if Floopy is saying,<strong

                Future Improvements: I think it would be great idea to add
