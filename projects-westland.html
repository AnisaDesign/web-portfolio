In Spring 2025, I completed a two-month practicum with Westland Insurance Group, one of Canada’s largest and best-reviewed insurance providers. My main projects included redesigning the internal employee SharePoint platform and collaborating with a senior service designer on research for a newcomer program. Alongside these, I supported various smaller projects, such as designing icons for new benefits sub-products, conducting a UX audit for the insurance broker website, and providing UX/UI recommendations aligned with the company’s design system.

Interesting task - creating voice recordings for Westland branches using the Revoicer platform (an AI-powered tool that converts text into realistic speech).
 My goal was to ensure that the messages sounded warm and friendly.
I carefully adjusted punctuation and spacing to create natural pauses and intonation. After generating the recordings, I listened to them and made phonetic adjustments where necessary to improve clarity and flow.

I initially worried that I might not clearly communicate my ideas to such an experienced group of professionals. To my surprise, the team’s feedback was both encouraging and insightful. One member told me, “You showed us some great ideas to consider moving forward,” while another noted that my work touched on governance and best practices. This experience taught me that effective communication is less about perfect fluency and more about delivering a clear message with meaningful impact.
